# IA340-Lab1-OConnor

Welcome to the IA 340 GitHub Lab Repository

This repository is my first IA 340 lab and it will contain notes, codes, and data related to the class at James Madison University. The goal of the course is to demonstrate my skills in python and other related skills I will need to excel in IA 340.
